# Programming Practices

## Current Best Practices Implemented

### Core Architecture & Design Principles

- **OOP Principles**:

  - **Inheritance**:
    - Code reuse through base classes (`BaseService`, `ExceptionHandlingServiceBase`)
    - Clear "is-a" relationships (e.g., `ProcessService` is a `BaseService`)
    - Shared functionality through parent classes
  - **Encapsulation**:
    - Services encapsulate their business logic and data access
    - Models encapsulate their data and relationships
    - Dependencies are encapsulated within their respective domains
    - Private methods (prefixed with `_`) hide implementation details
    - Clear separation between public and private interfaces
  - **Abstraction**:
    - Abstract base classes (`BaseLoggingService`) define interfaces
    - Dependency injection through abstract interfaces
    - Hiding complex implementation details behind simple interfaces
    - Example: `BaseLoggingService` abstract class enables different logging implementations
  - **Polymorphism**:
    - Ability to use different service types interchangeably through common interfaces
    - Consistent method signatures across service implementations
    - Runtime flexibility in choosing which implementation to use
    - Example: Any service inheriting from `BaseService` can be used where `BaseService` is expected

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
  - Base service classes with common functionality
  - Reusable exception handling through metaclasses
  - Shared logging and database operations

### Development & Code Quality

- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Async-first architecture using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, and Asyncpg
  - Dependency injection for database sessions and services
- **Code Organization**:
  - Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
  - Consistent file naming and structure
  - Proper use of type hints and documentation
- **Code Quality Tools**:
  - black formatter for PEP 8 compliance
  - flake8 for code style checking
  - isort for import sorting
  - mypy for type checking

### Database & API Layer

- **Database Practices**:
  - SQLAlchemy ORM with efficient relationship loading
  - Transaction management and proper foreign key relationships
  - Hybrid approach using raw SQL where ORM is inefficient
- **API Design**:
  - Clean route separation by domain
  - RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
  - Swagger UI documentation
  - Consistent parameter usage

### Error Handling & Testing

- **Error Management**:
  - Comprehensive exception hierarchy
  - Centralized exception handling through metaclasses
  - Proper logging of exceptions and business events
  - Transaction management with rollback support
- **Testing & Performance**:
  - Comprehensive unit tests with real database connections
  - Performance testing with Locust
  - Test coverage reporting

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- Containerization with Docker
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized image size

## Possible Best Practices to Consider (Out of scope for this POC)

1. Implement Redis for response caching and define cache invalidation strategies.
2. Add rate limiting middleware for enhanced security.
3. Use read replicas for scaling read operations.
4. Further optimize PostgreSQL functions for specific query patterns.
5. Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed data.
6. Document security best practices and add JWT authentication.
7. Migrate to Poetry for dependency management.
8. Implement CI/CD pipelines
9. Integrate pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
10. Automated build and run tests
